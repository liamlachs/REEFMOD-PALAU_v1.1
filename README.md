# REEFMOD-PALAU_v1.1

This repository contains the scripts of ReefMod-PALAU_v1.1, based on ReefMod-GBR_v6.8. It is a coral individual-based model that simulates 95 coral populations across the reef system of Palau. This version was used to explore the adaptive potential of corymbose Acropora corals under ocean warming, with a revised (compared to ReefMod-GBR_v6.8) implementation of coral bleaching. Instead of applying random mortalities at each reef based on marine heatwave stress,this model tracks individual coral heat tolerance. The model is used to explore future adaptive trajectories across three different future emissions scenarios (Paris Agreement limiting warming to 2C: SSP1-2.6; Middle-of-the-road: SSP2-4.5; Worst-case: SSP5-8.5) and for selective pressure forcings (i.e., future marine heatwave stress) from 16 different global climate models.
